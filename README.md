# mesibo_sample_app

## Problem
the sending of message is not working. you can verify that by following steps
1. login from 1st device as user 1
2. login from 2nd device as user 2
3. send messsage form user 1 to user 2
4. you wont receive the message and also the listener `Mesibo_onMessageStatus` is not called which further verifies that message is not sent
